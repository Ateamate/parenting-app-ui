Keep them out of children's reach and store them upside down.\n\n* Surround pools with a fence. A pool fence should have self-closing and self-latching gates, encircle the pool on all sides, and be at least four feet tall.\n\n* Learn CPR and the fundamentals of water rescue. It's critical to understand how to react in an emergency without endangering oneself."
