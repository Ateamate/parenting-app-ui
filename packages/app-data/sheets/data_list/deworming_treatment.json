Moreover, it also helps reduce worm infection that\noccurs in the community. \n\nDeworming also lowers the chances of hospital admission of kids suffering from abdominal pain.\n\nPeople should always wash their hands both before and after using the toilet to avoid possible exposure.\n\nItâ€™s recommend that deworming should get done twice a year or every six months from the age of two years old."
